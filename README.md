**Site Suitability Analysis Using Machine Learning for Solar Power Plant Construction**

This repository contains the implementation and code for a project that performs **site suitability analysis** using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **geospatial data** to identify optimal locations for constructing **solar power plants**.

---

Project Overview

Selecting the right locations for solar power installations is critical for maximizing energy yield and minimizing environmental impact. 
This project uses geospatial input data (solar irradiance,Temperature , cloudcover, LULC, slope, aspect,relative humidity ) and machine learning models
to generate a suitability map that ranks regions based on their potential for solar plant construction.

## 🚀 Objectives


- Acquire and preprocess relevant spatial and environmental data
- Normalize and scale raster datasets
- Train machine learning models that can evaluate site suitability
- Visualize the results as maps and heatmaps
- Aid decision-making for renewable energy planners
